This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an exchange rate travel application project. The directory is currently empty and ready for initial setup.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the following steps will likely be needed:

1. Initialize package.json: `npm init` or `yarn init`
2. Install dependencies based on chosen tech stack
3. Set up build tools and configuration

## Common Commands

Once the project is set up, typical commands will include:
- `npm install` or `yarn install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` or `yarn build` - Build for production
- `npm test` or `yarn test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` - Run linter

## Architecture Considerations

For an exchange rate travel app, consider these key components:
- Exchange rate API integration (e.g., Fixer.io, ExchangeRate-API)
- Currency conversion functionality
- Travel budget tracking
- Expense categorization
- Offline data caching
- Real-time rate updates

## Key Features to Implement

- Multi-currency support
- Historical exchange rate data
- Travel expense tracking
- Budget planning tools
- Expense categorization
- Receipt management
- Offline functionality
